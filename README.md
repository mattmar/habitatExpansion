# Expanding habitats and calculate ECA 
This repo offers a series of functions to grow patches of cells (habitats) inside a matrix (agricultural non-habitat) following simple spatial rules.
- Folder growing_functions contains functions to expand habitats
-  Folder connectivity_functions contains a function to calculate the Equivalent Connected Area (ECA)
-  TestMatrix.tif is a portion of a land use map that can be used for testing
-  imulate_expansion.r shows an example to grow habitat and calculate ECA starting from TestMatrix.tif
